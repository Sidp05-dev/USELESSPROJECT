### Project Description
talk2text is a fun, interactive speech-to-text app with a twist ‚Äî your words make an ASCII man dance!

üé§ Speak into your microphone and see your speech instantly transcribed.

üíÉ Watch him dance whenever you talk, stay idle when you‚Äôre silent.

üéµ Upload your voice and he‚Äôll groove in sync with the beat, thanks to real-time beat detection.

üòÖ The person will dance even if you don't say anything

Powered by OpenAI Whisper for accurate transcription and librosa for tempo detection, talk2text brings retro ASCII fun to your browser.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
No one is there to dance for us when we say anything

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
There is a person in the program who is dancing for us. He even dances when we don't speak.
