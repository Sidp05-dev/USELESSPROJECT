### Project Description
talk2text is a fun, interactive speech-to-text app with a twist ‚Äî your words make an ASCII man dance!

üé§ Speak into your microphone and see your speech instantly transcribed.

üíÉ Watch him dance whenever you talk, stay idle when you‚Äôre silent.

üéµ Upload music and he‚Äôll groove in sync with the beat, thanks to real-time beat detection.

Powered by OpenAI Whisper for accurate transcription and librosa for tempo detection, talk2text brings retro ASCII fun to your browser.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
No one is there to dance for us when we say anything

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
There is a person in the program who is dancing for us. He even dances when we don't speak.
